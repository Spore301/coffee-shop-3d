# My First Three.js Project

This project is my first foray into 3D web graphics using Three.js. It's a simple interactive scene created entirely with programmatic shapes and no external assets. All elements, from the coffee machine to the cups, are constructed using basic Three.js primitives and custom geometries.

## Features

*   **Pure Three.js:** Built from the ground up using only Three.js for 3D rendering.
*   **No External Assets:** All 3D models and textures are generated programmatically.
*   **Interactive Scene:** A basic interactive 3D environment.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have a local web server set up (e.g., `python -m http.server` or `npx http-server`).
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Start the web server.
4.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by your server).
